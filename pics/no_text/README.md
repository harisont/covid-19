# Images translation resources

This folder contains resources aimed at helping you translate the images for the article. 

The `.png` files are the equivalent of the files in the `/pics` folder with the text removed.

The `.xcf` files are files editable by the free image editor [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). They contain the original image and an overlay layer that hides the original text. You can flip it on and off while translating.

The files with the `_rtl` appended have been flipped to be used in RTL languages (mostly Arabic since Hebrew is done).
